# Stock Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the Stock Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the relationship between public sentiment and stock prices using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

In this project, we analyze the sentiment of news headlines related to specific stocks and investigate how these sentiments correlate with stock price movements. By leveraging sentiment analysis, we aim to provide insights that can help in making informed investment decisions.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathering stock price data and news headlines from reliable sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using NLP techniques to determine the sentiment of each headline (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring the relationship between sentiment scores and stock price movements.
- **Visualization**: Presenting the findings through interactive and informative visualizations.

## Key Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for developing and presenting the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK & TextBlob**: Libraries for natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations to showcase the results.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
